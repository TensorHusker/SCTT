# Research Log - Week 1

## Progress

This week we made significant progress on the core type checker implementation.

### Achievements

- ✅ Implemented basic type checking for smooth functions
- ✅ Added path type support
- ✅ Created initial web interface

### Challenges

Working through the interaction between smoothness and the cubical structure revealed some interesting edge cases:

```sctt
-- This should typecheck but currently doesn't
smooth-path : Path (C∞(ℝ, ℝ)) sin cos
smooth-path i = λ x → sin((1-i)*x) + i*cos(x)
```

### Next Steps

1. Fix path interpolation for smooth functions
2. Add derivative operator
3. Implement proof search

## Runetika Integration Ideas

Started analyzing game patterns from Runetika. The branching factor in mid-game positions correlates strongly with proof complexity. More research needed.

## Community Notes

Thanks to everyone who provided feedback on the initial release!
