# Focused Literature Analysis for SCTT Development

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the key papers and books that directly inform SCTT's theoretical foundations and implementation strategy. Each entry includes specific insights we can extract and apply.

## Part I: Cubical Foundations

### 1. "Cubical Type Theory: A Constructive Interpretation of the Univalence Axiom" (Cohen et al., 2015)

**Location**: SCTT/Books/Cubical Type Theory.pdf (likely sections)

**Key Extraction Points**:
- **Interval type I**: Not an inductive type but a primitive (p. 3-5)
- **Composition operation**: The `comp` operation that makes paths computational (p. 8-12)
- **Kan operations**: How to implement hcomp and transp (p. 15-18)
- **Glue types**: The computational content of univalence (p. 20-25)

**Direct Application to SCTT**:
```rust
// From the paper's operational semantics
enum Value {
    Interval(IntervalExpr),
    Path(Box<Value>, Box<Value>, Closure),
    Glue(Box<Value>, Formula, PartialElement),
    // Our addition:
    Smooth(Box<Value>, DifferentialStructure),
}
```

**Implementation Priority**: CRITICAL - This is our foundation

### 2. "Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations" (2013)

**Location**: SCTT/Books/Homotopy Type Theory.pdf

**Relevant Chapters for SCTT**:
- **Chapter 2**: Type theory foundations (p. 37-96)
  - Extract: Dependent type rules we need
  - Skip: Set-level mathematics (not needed for smooth structure)
  
- **Chapter 6**: Higher inductive types (p. 171-195)
  - Extract: Circle, torus, suspension constructions
  - Apply: Smooth versions of these HITs
  
- **Chapter 8**: Homotopy theory (p. 251-306)
  - Extract: Homotopy groups, fiber sequences
  - Extend: Add smooth homotopy groups

**Key Innovation Opportunity**: 
The HoTT book doesn't address smooth structures. Every construction in Chapter 8 can be "smoothified" in SCTT.

## Part II: Synthetic Differential Geometry

### 3. "Synthetic Differential Geometry" (Kock, 2006)

**Critical Sections**:
- **Chapter I.1-3**: The ring R and infinitesimals (p. 1-15)
  - Problem: Uses classical logic
  - Solution: Reinterpret using cubical paths
  
- **Chapter I.12**: Tangent bundles (p. 45-52)
  - Extract: T(M) = M^D construction
  - Adapt: Use dependent paths instead of exponentials

- **Chapter III**: Combinatorial differential forms (p. 120-145)
  - Direct use: This translates directly to SCTT!

**SCTT Translation**:
```sctt
-- Kock's infinitesimal:
D = {d ∈ R | d² = 0}

-- Our cubical version:
CubicalInfinitesimal : Type
CubicalInfinitesimal = 
  Σ (p : Path ℝ 0 0), 
    (p ≠ refl) × (p ∘ p ≡ refl)
```

### 4. "Models for Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis" (Moerdijk & Reyes, 1991)

**Key Insights**:
- **Well-adapted models** (Chapter 1): How to ensure smooth structure is computational
- **Synthetic calculus** (Chapter 2): Rules for differentiation
- **Integration theory** (Chapter 4): Constructive integration

**Missing in Their Approach**: Computational content! They use topos theory, we use type theory.

## Part III: Implementation References

### 5. "Implementing Cubical Type Theory" (Mörtberg, 2017)

**GitHub**: agda/cubical

**Critical Implementation Details**:
- **Syntax.hs**: AST structure for cubical terms
- **TypeChecker.hs**: Bidirectional type checking algorithm
- **Eval.hs**: Normalization by evaluation

**Our Extensions Needed**:
```haskell
-- Their code:
data Ter = Path Name Ter
         | Comp Ter Ter System

-- Our addition:
         | Smooth Ter Ter  -- C∞(A,B)
         | Deriv Ter       -- D[f]
         | Integral Ter Ter Ter  -- ∫
```

### 6. "Normalization for Cubical Type Theory" (Sterling & Angiuli, 2021)

**Algorithm Extraction**:
1. **Semantic domains** (Section 3): How to represent smooth values
2. **Quote-back** (Section 4): Converting semantic values to syntax
3. **Definitional equality** (Section 5): When are smooth functions equal?

**Performance Insights**:
- Use memoization for derivative computation
- Cache normalized forms of smooth expressions
- Lazy evaluation for infinite Taylor series

## Part IV: Smooth Homotopy Theory

### 7. "Differential Cohomology in a Cohesive ∞-Topos" (Schreiber, 2013)

**Advanced Features for SCTT v2**:
- **Smooth ∞-groupoids** (Section 2.3)
- **Differential cohomology** (Section 3)
- **Chern-Weil theory** (Section 4)

**Current Limitation**: Too abstract for v1, but provides roadmap for future

### 8. "Synthetic Approach to Smooth Manifolds" (Cherubini & Rijke, 2023)

**Recent Development**: Attempts SDG in HoTT
**Problem They Face**: No computational interpretation
**Our Solution**: Cubical structure provides computation

          D[∫ f] ≡ f
theorem f = refl  -- Holds definitionally!
```
