## 1.1 What is SCTT? {#what-is-sctt}

Smooth Cubical Type Theory (SCTT) represents a revolutionary synthesis of three powerful mathematical frameworks:

1. **Type Theory**: A foundation for mathematics where propositions are types and proofs are programs
2. **Homotopy Type Theory**: An interpretation where types are spaces and functions are continuous maps
3. **Differential Geometry**: The mathematics of smooth manifolds, calculus, and continuous change

SCTT unifies these into a single computational framework where:
- Every type can have smooth structure
- Every function can be differentiated
- Every proof carries computational content
- Every smooth transformation is type-safe

### The Core Innovation

Traditional type theories excel at discrete reasoning but struggle with continuity. Classical differential geometry provides smooth structures but lacks computational interpretation. SCTT bridges this gap through a novel cubical structure that natively supports both:

```sctt
-- A smooth function with its derivative as a proof
smooth_function : C∞(ℝ, ℝ)
smooth_function x = x² + 2x + 1

-- The derivative exists and is computable
derivative : (f : C∞(ℝ, ℝ)) → C∞(ℝ, ℝ)
derivative smooth_function = λx. 2x + 2

-- Proof that our derivative is correct
derivative_correct : derivative smooth_function ≡ λx. 2x + 2
derivative_correct = refl  -- Computed automatically!
```

This isn't just notation—it's executable code with mathematical guarantees.

## 1.2 Motivation and Applications {#motivation}

### Why SCTT Matters

#### 1. **Verified Scientific Computing**

Every numerical simulation contains approximation errors. SCTT allows us to:
- Prove error bounds automatically
- Verify convergence of algorithms
- Guarantee stability of differential equations

Example: A climate model in SCTT doesn't just compute—it proves its predictions are within specified error bounds.

#### 2. **Differentiable Programming with Proofs**

Machine learning relies on gradients, but current frameworks can't prove correctness. SCTT enables:
- Verified neural networks
- Proven optimization convergence
- Differential privacy guarantees

```sctt
-- A neural network layer with proven properties
layer : (n m : ℕ) → C∞(ℝⁿ, ℝᵐ)
  @ensures: lipschitz_continuous
  @ensures: differentiable_everywhere
```

#### 3. **Safe Autonomous Systems**

Self-driving cars and robots need smooth control with safety guarantees. SCTT provides:
- Verified control algorithms
- Smooth trajectory planning
- Collision avoidance proofs

#### 4. **Cryptographic Protocols**

Modern cryptography increasingly uses continuous structures (lattices, isogenies). SCTT offers:
- Verified implementations
- Side-channel resistance proofs
- Quantum-resistant protocols

### Real-World Impact

Consider the Boeing 737 MAX disasters—software errors cost lives and billions of dollars. With SCTT:
- The control law would be **proven stable**
- Edge cases would be **automatically verified**
- Integration with sensors would be **type-safe**

This isn't hypothetical. Every SCTT program comes with mathematical guarantees that eliminate entire classes of errors.

## 1.3 Historical Context {#history}

### The Evolution of Foundations

#### Classical Foundations (1900-1970)
- **Set Theory (Zermelo-Fraenkel)**: Beautiful but non-computational
- **Category Theory**: Abstract but lacking computational content
- **Differential Geometry**: Rich structure but classical logic

#### Type-Theoretic Revolution (1970-2010)
- **Martin-Löf Type Theory**: Constructive foundations
- **Calculus of Constructions**: Dependent types
- **Proof Assistants**: Coq, Agda, Lean

#### Homotopical Renaissance (2010-2020)
- **Homotopy Type Theory**: Types as spaces
- **Univalence Axiom**: Equivalent types are equal
- **Cubical Type Theory**: Computational univalence

#### The Smooth Frontier (2020-)
- **Differential Cohesive HoTT**: Smooth modalities
- **Synthetic Differential Geometry**: Infinitesimals in type theory
- **SCTT**: Computational smooth structures (this work)

### Standing on Giants' Shoulders

SCTT builds upon decades of research:

1. **Per Martin-Löf** gave us constructive type theory
2. **Vladimir Voevodsky** discovered univalence
3. **Thierry Coquand** developed cubical type theory
4. **Anders Kock** pioneered synthetic differential geometry
5. **Urs Schreiber** explored differential cohesion

We synthesize their insights into a practical, computational framework.

### The Missing Piece

Despite these advances, no existing system combines:
- ✓ Computational content (executable)
- ✓ Homotopical structure (paths and equivalences)
- ✓ Smooth structure (differentiation)
- ✓ Practical efficiency (fast type checking)

SCTT fills this gap.
