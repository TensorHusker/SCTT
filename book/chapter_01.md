## 1.1 What is SCTT? {#what-is-sctt}

Smooth Cubical Type Theory (SCTT) represents a revolutionary synthesis of three powerful mathematical frameworks:

1. **Type Theory**: A foundation for mathematics where propositions are types and proofs are programs
2. **Homotopy Type Theory**: An interpretation where types are spaces and functions are continuous maps
3. **Differential Geometry**: The mathematics of smooth manifolds, calculus, and continuous change

SCTT unifies these into a single computational framework where:
- Every type can have smooth structure
- Every function can be differentiated
- Every proof carries computational content
- Every smooth transformation is type-safe

### Formal Definition

SCTT is a dependent type theory equipped with:
1. **Cubical structure**: An interval type I with de Morgan algebra structure
2. **Path types**: Dependent paths PathP : (A : I → Type) → A i0 → A i1 → Type
3. **Smooth modality**: A comonad ♭ : SmoothType → Type preserving limits
4. **Differential structure**: Operations D : C∞(M,N) → C∞(TM,TN) satisfying chain rule

This yields a model of homotopy type theory with computational univalence and synthetic differential geometry.

### The Core Innovation

Traditional type theories excel at discrete reasoning but struggle with continuity. Classical differential geometry provides smooth structures but lacks computational interpretation. SCTT bridges this gap through a novel cubical structure that natively supports both.

#### The Fundamental Theorem of SCTT

**Theorem 1.1 (Smooth-Cubical Correspondence)**: There exists a model of type theory where:
1. The interval type I carries smooth structure compatible with its de Morgan algebra
2. Path types Path A x y are equivalent to smooth paths when A is a smooth type
3. The univalence axiom holds computationally via Glue types
4. Differentiation is a definitional operation on smooth functions

**Proof sketch**: We construct this model using cubical sets enriched with smooth structure, where the interval [0,1] has its standard smooth structure, and composition operations preserve smoothness. Full details in Chapter 8.

```sctt
-- A smooth function with its derivative as a proof
smooth_function : C∞(ℝ, ℝ)
smooth_function x = x² + 2x + 1

-- The derivative exists and is computable
derivative : (f : C∞(ℝ, ℝ)) → C∞(ℝ, ℝ)
derivative smooth_function = λx. 2x + 2

-- Proof that our derivative is correct
derivative_correct : derivative smooth_function ≡ λx. 2x + 2
derivative_correct = refl  -- Computed automatically!

-- The fundamental theorem of calculus holds definitionally
FTC : (f : C∞(ℝ, ℝ)) → (a b : ℝ) → 
      ∫ a b (derivative f) ≡ f b - f a
FTC f a b = refl  -- No proof needed!
```

This isn't just notation—it's executable code with mathematical guarantees.

## 1.2 Motivation and Applications {#motivation}

### Why SCTT Matters

#### 1. **Verified Scientific Computing**

Every numerical simulation contains approximation errors. SCTT allows us to:
- Prove error bounds automatically
- Verify convergence of algorithms
- Guarantee stability of differential equations

Example: A climate model in SCTT doesn't just compute—it proves its predictions are within specified error bounds.

#### 2. **Differentiable Programming with Proofs**

Machine learning relies on gradients, but current frameworks can't prove correctness. SCTT enables:
- Verified neural networks
- Proven optimization convergence
- Differential privacy guarantees

```sctt
-- A neural network layer with proven properties
layer : (n m : ℕ) → C∞(ℝⁿ, ℝᵐ)
  @ensures: lipschitz_continuous
  @ensures: differentiable_everywhere
```

#### 3. **Safe Autonomous Systems**

Self-driving cars and robots need smooth control with safety guarantees. SCTT provides:
- Verified control algorithms
- Smooth trajectory planning
- Collision avoidance proofs

#### 4. **Cryptographic Protocols**

Modern cryptography increasingly uses continuous structures (lattices, isogenies). SCTT offers:
- Verified implementations
- Side-channel resistance proofs
- Quantum-resistant protocols

### Real-World Impact

#### Case Study: Boeing 737 MAX

The Boeing 737 MAX disasters resulted from the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) software. With SCTT:

```sctt
-- MCAS control law with stability proof
MCAS : (sensor_angle : ℝ) → (control_output : ℝ)
  @requires: -90 ≤ sensor_angle ≤ 90
  @ensures: |control_output| ≤ max_deflection
  @ensures: is_lyapunov_stable MCAS

stability_proof : ∀ (ε : ℝ₊) → ∃ (δ : ℝ₊) →
                  |initial_state| < δ → 
                  |MCAS_trajectory t| < ε
stability_proof = construct_lyapunov_function
```

This isn't hypothetical. Every SCTT program comes with mathematical guarantees that eliminate entire classes of errors. The type system would have caught:
- Sensor input validation failures
- Missing redundancy checks  
- Unstable feedback loops
