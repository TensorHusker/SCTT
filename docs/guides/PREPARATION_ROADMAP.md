## Hands-On Exercises to Build Intuition

### Exercise Set A: Building Smooth Types
```agda
-- Start here: Define your first smooth type
record SmoothReal : Set where
  field
    value : ℝ
    derivatives : ℕ → ℝ  -- nth derivative
    smooth_proof : IsSmooth derivatives

-- Now you implement:
-- 1. Addition of smooth reals
-- 2. Multiplication of smooth reals
-- 3. Composition of smooth functions
-- 4. Prove chain rule holds
```

### Exercise Set B: Cubical Constructions
```agda
-- Build intuition for paths
path_exercise : Path ℝ 0 1
path_exercise = ⟨ i ⟩ i  -- The path from 0 to 1

-- Now you implement:
-- 1. A path on the circle
-- 2. A 2D path (surface)
-- 3. Composition of paths
-- 4. Prove path composition is associative
```

### Exercise Set C: The Integration Challenge
```agda
-- The big challenge: Make them work together
smooth_path : SmoothPath ℝ 0 1
smooth_path = ⟨ i ⟩ smooth_function i
  where smooth_function : C∞(I, ℝ)

-- Prove this preserves both structures!
```

### Pattern Recognition Exercises

**Week 1-4**: Notice patterns in type theory
**Week 5-8**: Notice patterns in smooth/cubical interaction
**Week 9-12**: Notice patterns in what makes things decidable
**Week 13-16**: Notice patterns nobody else has seen

## The Innovation Triggers

### When Stuck, Ask:
1. "What if we represented this differently?"
2. "What's the simplest case that still shows the problem?"
3. "What would make this decidable?"
4. "How would nature solve this?"
5. "What if we relaxed this requirement?"

### Creative Techniques:
- **Analogy**: "This is like [OTHER FIELD]..."
- **Inversion**: "What if we did the opposite?"
- **Composition**: "What if we combined these two ideas?"
- **Restriction**: "What if we only handled polynomials first?"
- **Generalization**: "What if this worked for all smooth spaces?"

## Your Personal SCTT Lab

### Build These Tools:
1. **Smooth Expression Evaluator**: Parse and evaluate smooth expressions
2. **Path Visualizer**: Draw paths and deformations
3. **Coherence Checker**: Verify smooth-cubical compatibility
4. **Prototype Type Checker**: Basic bidirectional checking
5. **Benchmark Suite**: Test performance hypotheses

### Track Your Progress:
- [ ] I understand dependent types
- [ ] I understand cubical type theory
- [ ] I understand smooth manifolds
- [ ] I can implement basic type checking
- [ ] I can prove simple theorems
- [ ] I see why coherence is hard
- [ ] I have my own ideas for solving it
- [ ] I've built a working prototype
- [ ] I've found something nobody else has seen

## The Breakthrough Moment

It will likely come when you:
1. Stop trying to force smooth into cubical or vice versa
2. Find a third structure that explains both
3. Realize certain "requirements" aren't actually required
4. See a pattern from another field applies
5. Build something that "shouldn't work" but does

## Remember

**You don't need to be a genius** - You need to be:
- Persistent (try many approaches)
- Creative (combine ideas in new ways)
- Systematic (document everything)
- Open (the solution might be unexpected)

**The key insight is probably**:
- Simpler than expected
- A unification rather than addition
- Already partially known in another field
- Hiding in the "obvious" cases

## Your Next Step

Start with Week 1, Day 1. Install Agda or Lean. Write your first typed program. The journey to inventing SCTT begins with understanding what we're trying to improve.

**Most importantly**: Trust your intuition. If something feels like it should work, try it. The biggest breakthroughs come from people who didn't know something was "impossible."
