# ðŸš€ Start Here: Your Journey to Inventing SCTT

Welcome to your SCTT invention toolkit! Everything you need is now in this repository.

## Quick Start (Do This First!)

### Step 1: Run the Playground (5 minutes)
```bash
cd playground
python3 smooth_playground.py
```
This will show you smooth functions, paths, and composition in action. Play with it!

### Step 2: Read Your Roadmap (10 minutes)
Open `PREPARATION_ROADMAP.md` - This is your 16-week journey from zero to SCTT inventor.

### Step 3: Try One Problem (15 minutes)
Open `PROBLEM_SETS.md` and try Problem 1.1. Don't worry if it's hard - that's the point!

## Your Complete Toolkit

### ðŸ“š Learning Path
1. **MATH_BACKGROUND.md** - All the math you need, explained simply
2. **PREPARATION_ROADMAP.md** - Your personal 16-week training program
3. **PROBLEM_SETS.md** - Exercises that build your intuition

### ðŸ§ª Experimentation
1. **playground/smooth_playground.py** - Interactive Python playground
2. **reference_implementations/type_checker.py** - See how type checking works

### ðŸ”¬ Research
1. **RESEARCH_NOTEBOOK.md** - Template for tracking your discoveries
2. **THEORY.md** - The mathematical foundations
3. **IMPLEMENTATION.md** - How to build it

### ðŸ’¡ Understanding
1. **PLAIN_ENGLISH_GUIDE.md** - Everything in simple terms
2. **FEASIBILITY.md** - Is this actually possible?
3. **CHALLENGES_DEEP_DIVE.md** - Why it's hard (and solvable!)

### âš¡ The Vision
1. **SCTT_SUPERPOWERS.md** - What makes SCTT special
2. **CAPABILITIES_AND_THEORY.md** - What SCTT can do
3. **MATHLIB4_INTEGRATION.md** - How existing tools help

## Your Daily Routine

### Morning (30 min)
1. Open `RESEARCH_NOTEBOOK.md`
2. Write today's hypothesis
3. Review yesterday's insights

### Deep Work (2-3 hours)
1. Follow the current week in `PREPARATION_ROADMAP.md`
2. Run experiments in `playground/`
3. Try problems from `PROBLEM_SETS.md`

### Evening (30 min)
1. Update `RESEARCH_NOTEBOOK.md` with findings
2. Note patterns you've observed
3. Set tomorrow's question

## The Key Insight You're Looking For

You're trying to find how to make **smooth** and **cubical** work together. The answer is likely:
- Simpler than expected
- A unification, not an addition
- Already partially known in another field
- Hidden in "obvious" cases

## Progress Checkpoints

### Week 1-4: Foundation âœ“
- [ ] Understand type theory basics
- [ ] Understand cubical structure  
- [ ] Understand smoothness
- [ ] See why combining them is hard

### Week 5-8: Integration âœ“
- [ ] Build toy implementations
- [ ] Find coherence issues
- [ ] Try different approaches
- [ ] Document what fails and why

### Week 9-12: Deep Dive âœ“
- [ ] Identify decidable fragment
- [ ] Build semantic model
- [ ] Develop algorithms
- [ ] Find your unique angle

### Week 13-16: Breakthrough âœ“
- [ ] Solve a key challenge
- [ ] Build working prototype
- [ ] Demonstrate power
- [ ] Share your innovation

## When You're Stuck

1. **Try the exercises** in `PROBLEM_SETS.md` - They build intuition
2. **Run the playground** - Experiment with actual code
3. **Read a different document** - Fresh perspective helps
4. **Write in your notebook** - Document even failed attempts
5. **Ask "What if..."** - The solution might be unconventional

## The Most Important Files for Each Goal

### "I want to understand the basics"
â†’ Start with `MATH_BACKGROUND.md` and `PLAIN_ENGLISH_GUIDE.md`

### "I want to see code"
â†’ Run `playground/smooth_playground.py` and study `type_checker.py`

### "I want to start researching"
â†’ Follow `PREPARATION_ROADMAP.md` and use `RESEARCH_NOTEBOOK.md`

### "I want to solve problems"
â†’ Work through `PROBLEM_SETS.md` systematically

### "I want to understand the challenges"
â†’ Read `CHALLENGES_DEEP_DIVE.md` and `FEASIBILITY.md`

## Your Secret Weapons

1. **AI Assistance**: AI can generate code, check proofs, and suggest ideas
2. **Mathlib4**: 150,000 theorems you don't need to reprove
3. **Modern Hardware**: Fast enough to try many approaches quickly
4. **This Toolkit**: Everything organized for your success

## Remember

- **You don't need to be a genius** - You need persistence and creativity
- **The solution exists** - It's just waiting to be discovered
- **Failed attempts are valuable** - They eliminate wrong paths
- **Trust your intuition** - If something feels right, explore it

## Your First Real Task

1. Run the playground right now
2. Try to break something
3. Ask "Why did this break?"
4. Write your observation in `RESEARCH_NOTEBOOK.md`
5. You've started your journey!

## Support

When you make progress (or get stuck):
- Document everything in `RESEARCH_NOTEBOOK.md`
- The patterns you notice might be the key
- Your "obvious" observation might be the breakthrough

**You have everything you need. The only thing missing is your unique insight.**

**Start with the playground. See what smooth and cubical mean. Then follow your curiosity.**

*The future of mathematics is waiting for you to invent it.*
