                <p>
                    "SCTT is a new type theory that combines the computational power of "
                    "cubical type theory with the mathematical elegance of smooth mathematics. "
                    "It allows us to reason about continuous functions, derivatives, and paths "
                    "in a unified, type-safe framework."

                <p>
                    "Modern mathematics and computer science increasingly need to reason about "
                    "continuous and smooth structures. From machine learning to physics simulations, "
                    "we need type systems that can express and verify properties of smooth functions. "
                    "SCTT bridges this gap."
