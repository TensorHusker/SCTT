## Prompt Engineering for SCTT

### Effective Prompts

#### Good: Specific and Contextual
```markdown
"Implement a type checker for SCTT smooth functions that:
1. Handles C^n and C^∞ differentiability
2. Includes proof annotations for soundness
3. Supports automatic differentiation
4. Has O(n log n) complexity
Include tests and documentation."
```

#### Better: With Examples
```markdown
"Here's my current smooth type:
```rust
enum SmoothType {
    Cn(usize, Type, Type),
    CInfinity(Type, Type),
}
```
Extend it to handle:
1. Smooth manifolds
2. Vector bundles
3. Differential forms
With formal semantics and proofs."
```

#### Best: Iterative Refinement
```markdown
"Building on our previous smooth type implementation:
[reference previous conversation]
Now add:
1. Composition of smooth maps
2. Proof that composition preserves smoothness
3. Optimize using memoization
4. Benchmark against baseline"
```
